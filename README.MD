# Jumia Scraper

Jumia Scraper extracts data from any Jumia product, catalog or category pages - parses and converts the data to structured formats: HTML table, JSON, CSV, Excel and XML.

By providing a search term (keyword) and/or category URL, you can extract prices, product descriptions, images, stock availability, brand, category, sku, etc.

## Why scrape Jumia products?
The extracted data can be useful in the following ways:
- Optimize product prices
- Monitor practices employed by your competitors
- Understand market dynamics to boost productivity
- Harness the power of prevailing trends, etc.

## Cost of usage
Apify generously offers you $5 free usage credits monthly. From our tests, you can scrape upto 400,000 results. This should be good enough for most of your use cases but you can upgrade to a higher plan to extract even more data.

## Sample input parameter
Below is a sample of the input
```json
{
  "startUrls": ["https://www.jumia.com.ng/health-beauty/"],
  "maxItems": 2000,
  "proxyConfig": {
    "useApifyProxy": false
  },
  "maxConcurrency": 1,
  "handlePageTimeoutSecs": 30000,
  "maxRequestRetries": 3
}
```

- `maxItems`: this specifies the maximum number or results you want to extract for a given run.
- `proxyConfig`: This field provides you with the option to use a proxy for the run or not. You can set the value to `{"useApifyProxy": true}` if you are getting blocked. By default, the scraper will use Apify's datacenter proxies but you can provide one instead, manually.
- `maxConcurrency`: This specifies the number of concurrent operations. To get your results quickly, set this to a higher number.
- `handlePageTimeoutSecs`: Number of seconds elapsed to mark a page as timeout.
- `maxRequestRetries`: Number of times the scraper will retry handling a failed page. The default value is `3` times.
- `startUrls`: This is an array of static URLs to be added to the request queue. It can be a product or category page.

## Limitation and solution
Category and Catalog pages can return a maximum of `2,000` results (this is a hard limit by Jumia). To extract more data, you can apply several filters e.g by price, brand, etc.

## Pagination
The scraper handles category and catalog pages pagination automatically, in a bid to extract as much data as possible. You can then use the `maxCrawledProducts` parameter to set the maximum number of the results to be obtained.
